Interstices Patch Library
=========================
Code to run the DMC light painting "Interstices," formerly of the Gilman tunnel at JHU, now being installed int the front of the [Digital Media Center](http://digitalmedia.jhu.edu).

To run this you will need:
* The [MondoMatrix Arduino libraries](http://mondomatrix.com/info/?page_id=364)

* You might need the older FTDI drivers for Arduino, found [here](http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm)

* A giant light painting.
